# normalization_project
This folder includes a Matlab program that aims at developing an automatic method for normalising diffusion MRI with the contralateral brain region based on its symmetry properties. 

# Motivation
The obstruction of an artery in the brain can cause an ischemic stroke. When this happens, clincians use diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find which area has been affected. Compared to the symetric hemisphere, the lesion area will appear in hyperintensity.

Our project is to use the symetrical nature of the brain to reveal automatically the lesion area, by first standardizing the images. Therefore, it would be possible to compare the wounds between different patients.
